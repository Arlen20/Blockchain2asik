# AI Model Marketplace (dApp)

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) for an AI Model Marketplace. It allows users to browse, purchase, and rate AI models on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## Features

- **Smart Contract Integration**: Interacts with an Ethereum smart contract to manage AI model listings, purchases, ratings, and withdrawals.
- **Frontend Interface**: Simple web interface for listing, purchasing, rating models, and viewing model details.
- **MetaMask Support**: Interact with the Ethereum network via MetaMask.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Required for the JavaScript backend
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - For deploying the smart contract and running the local blockchain

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-model-marketplace.git
cd ai-model-marketplace
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies:


npm install
3. Compile the Smart Contract
To compile the smart contract, run:


npx hardhat compile
4. Deploy the Smart Contract
Start the local Ethereum node:


npx hardhat node
In a new terminal, deploy the contract:


npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Take note of the contract address displayed after deployment.

5. Connect Frontend to Smart Contract
In frontend/app.js, replace YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the deployed contract address and add the contract's ABI to the contractABI variable.


const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
const contractABI = [
  // Contract ABI goes here
];
6. Run the Frontend
To serve the frontend on your local server, use Python's HTTP server (ensure you're in the frontend folder):


python -m http.server
Visit http://localhost:8000 to interact with the AI Model Marketplace dApp.

Usage
Listing Models: You can list AI models by interacting with the smart contract using the addModel function.
Purchasing Models: Use the purchaseModel function to buy AI models listed on the platform.
Rating Models: Rate AI models after purchase using the rateModel function.
Withdraw Earnings: Models creators can withdraw earnings using the withdraw function.
